Actuarial Analysis of Life Insurance Products
This repository contains a comprehensive actuarial evaluation of life insurance contracts (whole life and deferred annuities) using mortality tables, interest rate assumptions, and expense structures. Key features:

Models:
Whole Life Insurance: Calculates gross/net premiums, profit metrics (NPV, IRR), and sensitivity to risk discount rates, interest rates, policy benefits, and cash value terms.
Deferred Annuities: Analyzes actuarial present value (APV) trends tied to life expectancy.

Tools:
Sensitivity testing for profitability drivers (RDR, mortality tables, investment returns).
Comparison of gender-based mortality impacts (male vs. female life tables).

Data:
Historical USA life tables (1933â€“2015).

Expense and cash value logic for policy pricing.
Use Case: Designed for actuaries, insurers, and students to explore how mortality trends, interest rates, and product design impact life insurance pricing and profitability. Built with actuarial formulas in Python/R (code structure adaptable)
